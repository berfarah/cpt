# Roadmap

CPT is intended to be a tool for improving your Pivotal Workflow. My plans are
to support the following:

## Resource Interactions

### Stories

CRUD actions

Using our `$EDITOR`, we can create and update.

At the very top of stories there's a generated YAML block that gives us meta
information:

```yml
---
title: My ticket name
points: 3
requester: berfarah
owners:
  - berfarah
labels:
  - blocked
---
```
